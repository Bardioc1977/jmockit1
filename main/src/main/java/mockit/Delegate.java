/**
 * An empty interface to be used with the {@link Expectations#result} field or the
 * <a href="Expectations.html#with(mockit.Delegate)">Invocations#with(Delegate)</a> method, allowing test code to define varying invocation
 * results or argument matching rules, respectively.
 * <p>
 * When combined with the <code>result</code> field, a test will typically assign it with an anonymous class object implementing this interface
 * and containing a <em>delegate method</em>:
 * <pre>{@code
 *    new Expectations() {{
 *       mock.doSomething(anyInt, anyString);
 *       result = new Delegate() {
 *          String <strong>delegate</strong>(int i, String s) {
 *             return i > 0 ? s : "";
 *          }
 *       };
 *    }};
 * 
 *    tested.exerciseCodeUnderTest();
 * }</pre>
 * The delegate class (either named or anonymous) must contain exactly one non-<code>private</code> instance method to be executed when the
 * mocked method or mocked constructor is invoked; it can contain any number of <code>private</code> or <code>static</code> methods, though.
 * The name of the delegate method can be anything.
 * Its parameters, however, should be the same as the parameters of the corresponding mocked method/constructor, or at least be compatible
 * with them.
 * Optionally, the delegate method can have an extra parameter of type {@link Invocation}, provided it appears as the first one.
 * The delegate method is also allowed to have <em>no</em> parameters (without counting the optional <code>Invocation</code> parameter).
 * <p>
 * When used with the <code>result</code> field, the result of a delegate method execution can be any return value compatible with the recorded
 * method's return type, or a thrown error/exception.
 * <p>
 * When used with the <code>with(Delegate)</code> method, the delegate method must return a <code>boolean</code>, being <code>true</code> for a
 * successfully matched argument or <code>false</code> otherwise.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the argument to be matched, when used with the <code>with(Delegate)</code> method
 * @see <a href="http://jmockit.github.io/tutorial/Mocking.html#delegates" target="tutorial">Tutorial</a>
